This is a SMPC wallet.
This pdf file "Integrating SMPC in a crypto wallet" explains the development and implementation of a secure cryptocurrency wallet using SMPC to enhance the security of private keys while maintaining a seamless user experience.
The project splits the user's private key into multiple shares stored separately, reducing the risk of key exposure. 
Key functionalities include user registration, login, wallet creation, and token transactions on the Sepolia ETH network. 
The system architecture includes a Dart-based frontend for a dynamic user interface, a PHP and SQL backend for user authentication and database management, and a Python backend for blockchain interactions via the Moralis API. 
Despite challenges like integrating SMPC with string-based private keys and ensuring secure storage, the project successfully demonstrates the practical application of SMPC in enhancing cryptocurrency wallet security.
